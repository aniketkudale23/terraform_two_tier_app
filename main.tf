# main.tf

# This file orchestrates the overall Terraform configuration.
# Since resources are split into multiple files, main.tf can remain minimal.

# Optionally, you can include any global resources or module calls here.

# Example: Output all resources in one place (optional, since outputs.tf handles outputs)

# No additional configurations are necessary if all resources are defined in separate .tf files.
